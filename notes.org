Everything marked ~BACKLOG~ is an "if I have time" item.

** DONE Logging (gonna need a clearer picture of that which it is which is up)
** TODO Make lookup requests
** TODO Route for handling lookup
Let's do this
** TODO A view for displaying results
Needs at minimum to

1. [ ] Show the results of the lookup
2. [ ] Either [0/2]
   1. [ ] allow another search right there, or
   2. [ ] link back home

Ideally, given enough time:
1. [ ] Format things in a pleasing, human-readable way (not just pprinting EDN)

** BACKLOG Augment lookup params sensibly
